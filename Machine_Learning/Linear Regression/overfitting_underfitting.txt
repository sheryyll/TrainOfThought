OVERFITTING AND UNDERFITTING (BIAS AND VARIANCE)
-----------------------------------------------

While training a machine learning model, three important aspects must be considered:
    1. Training data
    2. Test data
    3. Validation data



Dataset usage
-------------
- The available dataset is first divided into two main parts:
    - Training dataset
    - Test dataset

- Training dataset
    - Used to train the model
    - The model learns patterns from this data

- Test dataset
    - Used to evaluate the trained model
    - Helps to check how well the model performs on unseen data



Train–Validation–Test split
----------------------------
- In practice, the training data is often split further into:
    - Train set
    - Validation set

Train set
    - Used to learn model parameters

Validation set
    - Used to tune hyperparameters
    - Used to select the best model

Test set
    - Used only for final evaluation



Training phase
--------------
- The training phase consists of two main steps:

    - Train
    - Validate

Train
    - The model is fitted using the training data

Validate
    - The trained model is tested on the validation data
    - Used to compare different models and settings



Model building flow
-------------------
    1. Choose a model
    2. Train the model on training data
    3. Tune the model using validation data
    4. Evaluate final performance on test data



Training error and test error
-----------------------------
Training error
    - Error computed on the training dataset

Test error
    - Error computed on the test dataset

The relation between these two errors gives important insight into model behaviour.



Underfitting
------------
A model is said to underfit when it is too simple to capture the underlying pattern in the data.

Typical characteristics
    - High training error
    - High test error
    - Poor performance on both seen and unseen data

This situation is usually caused by:
    - Very simple model
    - Important features not used
    - Insufficient training time

This behaviour is associated with:
    - High bias
    - Low variance



Overfitting
-----------
A model is said to overfit when it learns the training data too well, including noise.

Typical characteristics
    - Very low training error
    - High test error
    - Poor generalisation to new data

This situation is usually caused by:
    - Very complex model
    - Too many features
    - Model memorising the training data

This behaviour is associated with:
    - Low bias
    - High variance



Good fit
--------
A good model achieves a balance between underfitting and overfitting.

Typical characteristics
    - Low training error
    - Low test error
    - Small gap between training and test error

Such a model generalises well to unseen data.



Bias and variance
-----------------
Bias
    - Error caused by overly simple assumptions in the model
    - High bias leads to underfitting

Variance
    - Error caused by sensitivity to small changes in the training data
    - High variance leads to overfitting



Visual intuition
----------------
Underfitting
    - The model cannot follow the trend of the data
    - Predictions remain too simple

Overfitting
    - The model follows almost every data point
    - Predictions fluctuate heavily

Good fit
    - The model follows the general pattern without fitting noise



Relation between model complexity and errors
--------------------------------------------
As model complexity increases:
    - Training error usually decreases
    - Test error decreases initially, then starts increasing

The minimum test error corresponds to the best model complexity.



How to reduce underfitting
--------------------------
    - Use a more complex model
    - Add relevant features
    - Reduce regularisation



How to reduce overfitting
-------------------------
    - Use more training data
    - Apply regularisation
    - Reduce model complexity
    - Perform proper hyperparameter tuning



Final note
----------
- Underfitting and overfitting describe two extreme behaviours of a model.
- The main goal of machine learning is to achieve good generalisation by finding a proper balance between bias and variance.
