POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION
--------------------

Polynomial regression is used when the relationship between the input and output is not linear.
It models a curved relationship by adding higher-power terms of the input features to a linear model.



Linear and non-linear relationships
-----------------------------------

Simple linear regression
    h(x) = β0 + β1 x
This represents a straight line relationship between x and y.


Multiple linear regression
    h(x) = β0 + β1 x1 + β2 x2 + β3 x3
This is still linear in the parameters and models multiple input features.


When the straight line cannot fit the data well, a polynomial form is used.



Polynomial regression model
---------------------------

Polynomial regression extends linear regression by adding powers of the input feature.
General form for one input feature x

    h(x) = β0 + β1 x + β2 x² + β3 x³ + … + βd x^d
        d is called the degree of the polynomial.



Meaning of polynomial degree
----------------------------

The degree decides the highest power of the input variable.
    degree = 0  → constant model
    degree = 1  → simple linear regression
    degree = 2  → quadratic model
    degree = d  → polynomial model of degree d



Special cases
-------------
Degree 0
    h(x) = β0
The prediction is a constant value.


Degree 1
    h(x) = β0 + β1 x
This becomes simple linear regression.


Degree 2
    h(x) = β0 + β1 x + β2 x²


Degree n
    h(x) = β0 + β1 x + β2 x² + … + βn x^n



Important observation
---------------------
Although polynomial regression models a non-linear relationship between x and y, the model is still linear in the parameters β.
This means it can be trained using ordinary least squares, just like linear regression.



Simple polynomial regression
----------------------------
Simple polynomial regression uses:
    - one input feature
    - one output feature
Only the powers of the same input variable are added.



Multiple input polynomial regression
------------------------------------
Polynomial regression can also be applied when there are multiple input features.

For two input features x1 and x2, a polynomial model can be written as
    h(x) = β0 + β1 x1 + β2 x2 + β3 x1² + β4 x2²

These are still treated as independent features after transformation.



Geometric intuition
-------------------
As the degree increases, the model becomes more flexible and can fit more complex curves.
A very small degree may underfit the data.
A very large degree may overfit and start fitting noise instead of the true pattern.



Effect of increasing degree
----------------------------
    - Low degree  → high bias, simple curve
    - Moderate degree → better fit
    - Very high degree → high variance and overfitting



Final note
----------
Polynomial regression is a feature transformation technique that allows linear regression models to capture non-linear relationships by using polynomial features.
