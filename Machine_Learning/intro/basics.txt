AI vs ML vs DL vs DS

1) Artificial Intelligence (AI)
2) Machine Learning (ML)
3) Deep Learning (DL)
4) Data Science (DS)


Artificial Intelligence (AI):
AI is the concept of creating an application or system that can perform
its own tasks without any human intervention.

Example:
- Netflix Recommendation System
  User watches action movies
  → System recommends action movies automatically


Machine Learning (ML):
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.
It allows systems to learn from data and improve performance
without being explicitly programmed.


Deep Learning (DL):
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning.
It uses multi-layered neural networks.
Deep Learning attempts to mimic the human brain
using artificial neural networks.


Data Science (DS):
Data Science provides statistical tools to:
- analyze data
- visualize data
- perform predictions
- perform forecasting on data


Relationship Summary:
- Artificial Intelligence is the broadest field.
- Machine Learning is a subset of AI.
- Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning.
- Data Science overlaps with AI and ML and focuses on data analysis
  and decision-making using data.
