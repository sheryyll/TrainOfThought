Learning can be broadly divided into

1) Memorizing  →  Instance Based Learning
2) Generalizing →  Model Based Learning


--------------------------------------------------------------

INSTANCE BASED LEARNING

- Instance based learning is a learning approach in which the algorithm
    does not build an explicit global model.
- Instead, it stores (memorizes) the training data and makes predictions
    for a new input by comparing it directly with the stored instances.

Learning pattern:

    DATA  →  OUTPUT
    (No explicit generalized model is created)

Important idea:
    → Memorize the data
    → Use similarity / distance at prediction time

Training phase:
- There is almost no training. The algorithm mainly stores the data.

Prediction (scoring) phase:
- For a new input,
    the algorithm searches for similar examples in the stored data
    and decides the output based on them.

Example features (as shown in the figure):
    No. of play hours
    No. of study hours

Example output:
    Pass / Fail

The decision is made using nearby points instead of a learned decision boundary.

Common algorithm:
    KNN (K Nearest Neighbours)

    KNN – Working idea:
        For a test point,
        1) Find the K closest data points
        2) Look at their labels
        3) Assign the majority label


Important characteristics:
- Memorizes the complete training data
- No explicit generalized model
- Decision is made at test time
- Highly dependent on distance / similarity measure
- Prediction can be slow for large datasets
- Storage requirement is high


Instance based learning mainly depends on domain knowledge and similarity measures.

--------------------------------------------------------------

MODEL BASED LEARNING

- Model based learning is a learning approach in which the algorithm
    learns a generalized model from the training data.
- It tries to discover patterns in the data
    and represents those patterns in the form of a model.

Learning pattern:
    DATA  →  PATTERN  →  GENERALIZED MODEL

Training phase:
- A model is trained using the given data and model parameters are learned.

Prediction (scoring) phase:
- The learned model is directly used to predict the output for unseen data.

The model represents a generalized form of the data.

Important idea:
    → Learn patterns
    → Generalize
    → Build a model
    → Use the model for future predictions


Example:
A decision boundary is learned during training. At test time, the point is simply checked
on which side of the boundary it lies.

Important characteristics:

- Explicit generalized model is created
- Data can be discarded after training
- Prediction is fast
- Storage requirement is usually lower than instance based learning
- Training time can be high
