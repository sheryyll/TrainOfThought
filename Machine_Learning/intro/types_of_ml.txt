3 Types of Machine Learning

Machine Learning Techniques

1) Supervised Machine Learning
2) Unsupervised Machine Learning
3) Reinforcement Learning

1) Supervised Machine Learning 
--------------------------------------------------

Supervised Machine Learning is a type of machine learning in which the
model is trained using labeled data.
Each training example contains input features and the correct output.
The goal is to learn a mapping between input and output so that the
model can make accurate predictions for new, unseen data.

Supervised ML techniques mainly include:
- Regression
- Classification


Example – Regression (Predicting house price)

Dataset:

Independent features:
- Size of house
- Number of rooms

Dependent / output feature:
- Price

Sample data:
Size of house | No. of rooms | Price
5000          | 5            | 450K
6000          | 6            | 500K
...           | ...          | ...

Note:
- Independent feature → input feature
- Dependent feature → output feature

If the dependent/output feature is continuous → Regression
If the dependent/output feature is categorical → Classification


Example – Classification

Independent features:
- Number of study hours
- Number of play hours

Dependent feature:
- Result

Sample data:

Study hours | Play hours | Result
7           | 3          | Pass
2           | 6          | Fail
...         | ...        | Maybe

This can be:
- Binary classification
- Multi-class classification

2) Unsupervised Machine Learning 
--------------------------------------------------

Unsupervised Machine Learning is a type of machine learning in which the
model is trained using unlabeled data.
The algorithm tries to discover hidden patterns, structures, or groups
in the data without knowing the correct output in advance.

Example:
Customer segmentation (clustering)

Sample dataset:

Salary | Spending score (1–10)
20000  | 9
45000  | 2
...    | ...

Goal:
Group similar customers into clusters.

Example use case:
An e-commerce company groups customers into clusters and sends emails
with similar offers or discounts to customers belonging to the same
cluster.


Unsupervised ML algorithms:
- K-Means
- Hierarchical clustering
- DBSCAN clustering

Supervised ML algorithms
--------------------------------------------------

1) Linear Regression
2) Ridge and Lasso
3) ElasticNet
4) Logistic Regression (Classification)
5) Decision Tree   (Both classification and regression)
6) Random Forest   (Both classification and regression)
7) AdaBoost
8) XGBoost


--------------------------------------------------
3) Reinforcement Learning 
--------------------------------------------------

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning in which an agent
learns by interacting with an environment.
The agent takes actions and receives feedback in the form of rewards
or penalties.
The objective is to learn an optimal policy that maximizes the total
cumulative reward over time.
