LOGISTIC REGRESSION (ONE VS REST)

- Logistic Regression can be extended to solve Multiclass Classification problems.
- The important technique used is called One Versus Rest (OVR), also known as One Vs All (OVA).
- It allows Logistic Regression (which is originally binary) to handle multiple classes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS ONE VS REST?

In One Vs Rest:
- For K classes, we create K separate binary classification models.
- Each model learns to distinguish:
    One class vs All other classes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Example:

f1   f2   f3   Output
-    -    -    O1
-    -    -    O2
-    -    -    O3
-    -    -    O1
-    -    -    O3
-    -    -    O2

There are 3 classes: O1, O2, O3

So we create 3 models:

Model M1 → O1 vs (O2, O3)
Model M2 → O2 vs (O1, O3)
Model M3 → O3 vs (O1, O2)

Each model is a binary logistic regression model.

HOW TRAINING WORKS

- For Model M1:
    O1 is labeled as 1
    O2 and O3 are labeled as 0

- For Model M2:
    O2 is labeled as 1
    O1 and O3 are labeled as 0

- For Model M3:
    O3 is labeled as 1
    O1 and O2 are labeled as 0

This is similar to performing One Hot Encoding on the output labels.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW PREDICTION WORKS

When a new test data point is passed:
- All models calculate probability.
- The model that gives the highest probability wins.

Example:

M1      M2      M3
0.25    0.20    0.55

Since M3 gives highest probability (0.55),
Final predicted class = O3

--------------------------------------------------------------------

KEY POINTS

- One Vs Rest converts multiclass into multiple binary problems.
- Number of models = Number of classes.
- Final prediction is based on highest probability.
- Commonly used in Logistic Regression and Linear Classifiers.
