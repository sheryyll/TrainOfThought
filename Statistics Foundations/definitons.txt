STATISTICS

Statistics is a field that deals with the collection, organization, interpretation,
analysis, and presentation of data.

Statistics helps in decision-making by analyzing data and drawing meaningful
conclusions from data.


APPLICATIONS OF STATISTICS

Statistics is used in almost every domain and field, including:

- Day-to-day activities
- Machine Learning
- Data Analysis
- Business Analysis
- Risk Analysis
- Healthcare
- Education
- Government and policy making

Example:
- Finding the feasibility and effectiveness of vaccination programs

TYPES OF STATISTICS


1. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

Descriptive statistics focuses on organizing, summarizing, and presenting data
in a meaningful way.

Examples:

Measures of Central Tendency:
- Mean
- Median
- Mode

Measures of Dispersion:
- Variance
- Standard Deviation


2. INFERENTIAL STATISTICS

Inferential statistics uses data from a sample to make conclusions or predictions
about a larger population.

Examples:
- Hypothesis testing
- Confidence intervals
- Regression analysis


---------------------------------------------------------------------

POPULATION AND SAMPLE


Population:
The population refers to the entire group of individuals, objects, or data that we
want to study.

Examples:
- All citizens of a country
- All students in a university
- All manufactured items in a factory


Sample:
A sample is a smaller subset selected from the population to represent the entire
population.

Examples:
- A group of 500 voters selected from a city
- 50 students chosen from a class of 500 students


Relationship between Population and Sample:
- Population → Entire data set
- Sample → Part of the population
- Conclusions about the population are drawn using sample data


---------------------------------------------------------------------

MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY


1. MEAN

- Mean of a population refers to the average of the population.

- Population Mean:
  Population mean is denoted by μ and is given by:
  μ = (ΣX) / N

  Where:
  ΣX = sum of all population values
  N  = total number of values in the population

- Sample Mean:
  Sample mean is denoted by x̄ and is given by:
  x̄ = (Σx) / n

  Where:
  Σx = sum of all sample values
  n  = total number of values in the sample


2. MEDIAN

- Median is the middle value of a dataset when the data is arranged
  in ascending or descending order.

- If the number of observations (n) is odd:
  Median = value of the (n + 1) / 2 th observation

- If the number of observations (n) is even:
  Median = average of the (n / 2) th and (n / 2 + 1) th observations


3. MODE

- Mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset.

- A dataset may have:
  • One mode (Unimodal)
  • Two modes (Bimodal)
  • More than two modes (Multimodal)
  • No mode (if all values occur with the same frequency)


---------------------------------------------------------------------

MEASURES OF DISPERSION

Measures of dispersion describe how spread out or scattered the data values
are around a central value.


1. RANGE

- Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.

- Formula:
  Range = Maximum value − Minimum value


2. VARIANCE

- Variance measures the average of the squared deviations from the mean.
- It shows how far the data values are spread from the mean.


- Population Variance:
  Population variance is denoted by σ² and is given by:
  σ² = (Σ (X − μ)²) / N

  Where:
  X  = each population value
  μ  = population mean
  N  = total number of population values


- Sample Variance:
  Sample variance is denoted by s² and is given by:
  s² = (Σ (x − x̄)²) / (n − 1)

  Where:
  x  = each sample value
  x̄ = sample mean
  n  = total number of sample values


3. STANDARD DEVIATION

- Standard deviation is the square root of variance.
- It measures the average distance of data values from the mean.


- Population Standard Deviation:
  Population standard deviation is denoted by σ and is given by:
  σ = √[(Σ (X − μ)²) / N]


- Sample Standard Deviation:
  Sample standard deviation is denoted by s and is given by:
  s = √[(Σ (x − x̄)²) / (n − 1)]


---------------------------------------------------------------------

BASAL CORRECTION

- Basal correction is used while calculating sample variance.

- Sample variance is calculated by:
    s² = Σ(x − x̄)² / (n − 1)
- Dividing by (n − 1) instead of n avoids underestimation
  of the population variance.
- Degree of Freedom (DF): n - 1


---------------------------------------------------------------------

VARIABLE

- A variable is a property or characteristic that can take different values.
- Example:
    Age = 25
    Gender = Male


TYPES OF VARIABLES

1. Quantitative Variable:
   - Variables that can be measured numerically.

   a. Discrete Quantitative Variable:
      - Takes only whole number values.
      - Example: Number of students, Number of cars

   b. Continuous Quantitative Variable:
      - Can take any value within a range.
      - Example: Height, Weight, Temperature


2. Qualitative / Categorical Variable:
   - Variables that describe qualities or categories.
   - Example: Gender, Blood group, Color


---------------------------------------------------------------------

RANDOM VARIABLE:

   - A variable whose value depends on the outcome of a random experiment.
   - It is usually represented by a capital letter (X, Y).
   - Example:
       X = Number of heads obtained when a coin is tossed
  
TYPES OF RANDOM VARIABLES

1. Discrete Random Variable:
   - Takes only countable values.
   - Usually obtained by counting.
   - Example:
       X = Number of heads in 3 coin tosses

2. Continuous Random Variable:
   - Takes any value within a given range.
   - Usually obtained by measurement.
   - Example:
       X = Height of students


---------------------------------------------------------------------

HISTOGRAM

- A histogram is a graphical representation of a frequency distribution
  of a continuous variable.

- In a histogram:
  • The horizontal axis (X-axis) represents class intervals.
  • The vertical axis (Y-axis) represents frequencies.

- Rectangular bars are drawn for each class interval.

- The bars in a histogram:
  • Have no gaps between them.
  • Touch each other because the data is continuous.

- The width of each bar represents the class interval,
  and the height represents the frequency.


EXAMPLE

Class Interval     Frequency
0 – 10                 5
10 – 20                9
20 – 30                6
30 – 40                4

- On the X-axis, take the class intervals.
- On the Y-axis, take the frequencies.
- Draw rectangles for each class interval.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION (PDF) FROM HISTOGRAM

- A probability density function represents the probability distribution
  of a continuous random variable.

- A histogram can be converted into a probability density function.

- To obtain a PDF from a histogram:
  • Divide the frequency of each class interval by
    (total number of observations × class width).

- After this conversion:
  • The total area under the histogram becomes 1.
  • The height of each bar represents probability density.

- Probability density is given by:

    Probability Density = Frequency / (Total Frequency × Class Width)

- The histogram obtained after this conversion is called
  a probability density histogram.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

PERCENTILES AND QUARTILES

- Percentiles and quartiles are measures of position.
- They divide a data set into equal parts.


QUARTILES

- Quartiles divide the data into four equal parts.

- Important values in quartile representation:

  • Minimum             : Smallest value in the data set
  • Q1 (1st Quartile)   : 25% of the data lies below Q1
  • Q2 (Median)        : 50% of the data lies below Q2
  • Q3 (3rd Quartile)  : 75% of the data lies below Q3
  • Maximum             : Largest value in the data set


QUARTILE FORMULAS

For Ungrouped Data:

- Position of quartiles:

    Q1 = (n + 1) / 4
    Q2 = (n + 1) / 2
    Q3 = 3(n + 1) / 4

  where,
    n = total number of observations


For Grouped Data:

- Quartile formula:

    Qk = L + [ ( (kN / 4) − cf ) / f ] × h

  where,
    k  = 1, 2, or 3
    L  = lower limit of the quartile class
    N  = total frequency
    cf = cumulative frequency of the class preceding
         the quartile class
    f  = frequency of the quartile class
    h  = class width


INTERQUARTILE RANGE (IQR)

- Interquartile Range measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data.

- It is defined as:

    IQR = Q3 − Q1

- IQR is less affected by extreme values (outliers).


LOWER FENCE AND UPPER FENCE

- Lower and upper fences are used to identify outliers.

- Formulas:

    Lower Fence (LF) = Q1 − 1.5 × IQR
    Upper Fence (UF) = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR

- Any value less than LF is a lower outlier.
- Any value greater than UF is an upper outlier.


PERCENTILES

- Percentiles divide the data into 100 equal parts.

- The kᵗʰ percentile (Pk) is the value below which
  k% of the observations lie.

- Example:
    P25 = First quartile (Q1)
    P50 = Median (Q2)
    P75 = Third quartile (Q3)


---------------------------------------------------------------------

COVARIANCE AND CORRELATION

- Covariance and correlation are measures of the relationship
  between two variables.


COVARIANCE

- Covariance indicates the direction of the relationship
  between two variables.

- If covariance is:
  • Positive → variables increase together
  • Negative → one variable increases while the other decreases
  • Zero     → no linear relationship

- Formula for covariance:

  For population:

    Cov(X, Y) = Σ[(X − μx)(Y − μy)] / N

  For sample:

    Cov(X, Y) = Σ[(X − x̄)(Y − ȳ)] / (n − 1)


CORRELATION

- Correlation measures both the direction and strength
  of the relationship between two variables.

- Correlation coefficient is denoted by r.

- Value of r lies between −1 and +1.

  • r = +1 → Perfect positive correlation
  • r = −1 → Perfect negative correlation
  • r = 0  → No linear correlation

- Formula for correlation coefficient:

    r = Cov(X, Y) / (σx σy)

- Correlation is independent of change of origin and scale.
