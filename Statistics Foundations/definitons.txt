STATISTICS

Statistics is a field that deals with the collection, organization, interpretation,
analysis, and presentation of data.

Statistics helps in decision-making by analyzing data and drawing meaningful
conclusions from data.


APPLICATIONS OF STATISTICS

Statistics is used in almost every domain and field, including:

- Day-to-day activities
- Machine Learning
- Data Analysis
- Business Analysis
- Risk Analysis
- Healthcare
- Education
- Government and policy making

Example:
- Finding the feasibility and effectiveness of vaccination programs

TYPES OF STATISTICS


1. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

Descriptive statistics focuses on organizing, summarizing, and presenting data
in a meaningful way.

Examples:

Measures of Central Tendency:
- Mean
- Median
- Mode

Measures of Dispersion:
- Variance
- Standard Deviation


2. INFERENTIAL STATISTICS

Inferential statistics uses data from a sample to make conclusions or predictions
about a larger population.

Examples:
- Hypothesis testing
- Confidence intervals
- Regression analysis

POPULATION AND SAMPLE


Population:
The population refers to the entire group of individuals, objects, or data that we
want to study.

Examples:
- All citizens of a country
- All students in a university
- All manufactured items in a factory


Sample:
A sample is a smaller subset selected from the population to represent the entire
population.

Examples:
- A group of 500 voters selected from a city
- 50 students chosen from a class of 500 students


Relationship between Population and Sample:
- Population → Entire data set
- Sample → Part of the population
- Conclusions about the population are drawn using sample data

MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY


1. MEAN

- Mean of a population refers to the average of the population.

- Population Mean:
  Population mean is denoted by μ and is given by:
  μ = (ΣX) / N

  Where:
  ΣX = sum of all population values
  N  = total number of values in the population

- Sample Mean:
  Sample mean is denoted by x̄ and is given by:
  x̄ = (Σx) / n

  Where:
  Σx = sum of all sample values
  n  = total number of values in the sample


2. MEDIAN

- Median is the middle value of a dataset when the data is arranged
  in ascending or descending order.

- If the number of observations (n) is odd:
  Median = value of the (n + 1) / 2 th observation

- If the number of observations (n) is even:
  Median = average of the (n / 2) th and (n / 2 + 1) th observations


3. MODE

- Mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset.

- A dataset may have:
  • One mode (Unimodal)
  • Two modes (Bimodal)
  • More than two modes (Multimodal)
  • No mode (if all values occur with the same frequency)


---------------------------------------------------------------------

MEASURES OF DISPERSION

Measures of dispersion describe how spread out or scattered the data values
are around a central value.


1. RANGE

- Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.

- Formula:
  Range = Maximum value − Minimum value


2. VARIANCE

- Variance measures the average of the squared deviations from the mean.
- It shows how far the data values are spread from the mean.


- Population Variance:
  Population variance is denoted by σ² and is given by:
  σ² = (Σ (X − μ)²) / N

  Where:
  X  = each population value
  μ  = population mean
  N  = total number of population values


- Sample Variance:
  Sample variance is denoted by s² and is given by:
  s² = (Σ (x − x̄)²) / (n − 1)

  Where:
  x  = each sample value
  x̄ = sample mean
  n  = total number of sample values


3. STANDARD DEVIATION

- Standard deviation is the square root of variance.
- It measures the average distance of data values from the mean.


- Population Standard Deviation:
  Population standard deviation is denoted by σ and is given by:
  σ = √[(Σ (X − μ)²) / N]


- Sample Standard Deviation:
  Sample standard deviation is denoted by s and is given by:
  s = √[(Σ (x − x̄)²) / (n − 1)]
