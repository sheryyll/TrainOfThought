PROBABILITY

- Probability deals with determining the likelihood of occurrence of an event.

- Example:
  Likelihood of getting a head when a coin is tossed.
  P(H) = 1 / 2


---------------------------------------------------------------------

MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE EVENTS

- Two events are said to be mutually exclusive if they cannot occur
  at the same time.

- Example:
  Appearance of head and tail in a single toss of a coin.


ADDITION RULE FOR MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE EVENTS

P(H or T) = P(H) + P(T)


---------------------------------------------------------------------

NON-MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE EVENTS

- Two events are said to be non-mutually exclusive if they can occur
  at the same time.

- Example:
  Probability of drawing a King card or a Heart card from a deck of cards.


ADDITION RULE FOR NON-MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE EVENTS

P(K or H) = P(K) + P(H) − P(K and H)

          = (4 / 52) + (13 / 52) − (1 / 52)

          = 16 / 52

MULTIPLICATION RULE


INDEPENDENT EVENTS

- Two events are said to be independent if the occurrence of one event
  does not affect the occurrence of the other.

- Example:
  Tossing a coin twice. The occurrence of Head in the first toss does not
  affect the occurrence of Tail in the second toss.

- Multiplication Rule for Independent Events:

  P(H and T) = P(H) × P(T)
             = (1 / 2) × (1 / 2)
             = 1 / 4



DEPENDENT EVENTS

- Two events are said to be dependent if the occurrence of one event
  affects the occurrence of the other.

- Example:
  Drawing a King from a deck of cards and then drawing a Queen
  without replacement.

- Multiplication Rule for Dependent Events:

  P(K and Q) = P(K) × P(Q | K)
             = (4 / 52) × (4 / 51)

- Here, P(Q | K) represents conditional probability.
