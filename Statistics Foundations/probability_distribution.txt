PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS

- Probability Distribution Functions describe how probabilities are
  distributed over the possible values of a random variable.

- A random variable is a variable whose values are determined
  by the outcome of a random experiment and is usually denoted by X.

TYPES OF PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS


1. PROBABILITY MASS FUNCTION (PMF)

- Probability Mass Function is used for discrete random variables.

- PMF is denoted by:
  P(X = x) or f(x)

- It gives the probability that a discrete random variable X
  takes a specific value x.

- Properties of PMF:
  • 0 ≤ P(X = x) ≤ 1
  • Σ P(X = x) = 1 (sum over all possible values)

- Example:
  Rolling a fair die.

  P(X = 1) = P(X = 2) = P(X = 3) =
  P(X = 4) = P(X = 5) = P(X = 6) = 1/6

- In the graph:
  x-axis represents the possible values {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
  y-axis represents the corresponding probabilities {1/6}


---------------------------------------------------------------------

2. PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION (PDF)

- Probability Density Function is used for continuous random variables.

- PDF is denoted by:
  f(x)

- For continuous random variables:
  P(X = x) = 0

- Probability is represented by the area under the curve
  between two points, not by exact values.

- Probability over an interval:
  P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = ∫[a to b] f(x) dx


PDF PROPERTIES

- Non-negativity:
  f(x) ≥ 0 for all values of x

- Total area under the PDF curve is equal to 1:
  ∫[−∞ to +∞] f(x) dx = 1

- The shape of f(x) depends on the type of distribution.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

CUMULATIVE DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION (CDF)

- Cumulative Distribution Function represents the cumulative
  probability up to a certain value of the random variable.

- It is obtained by accumulating probabilities as we move
  from left to right along the x-axis.

- CDF is denoted by:
  F(x)

- Definition:
  F(x) = P(X ≤ x)

- Range of CDF:
  0 ≤ F(x) ≤ 1

- In the discrete case:
  CDF is a step function.

- Example (discrete):
  P(X ≤ 2) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)


---------------------------------------------------------------------

RELATION BETWEEN PDF AND CDF

- CDF is the integral of PDF:
  F(x) = ∫[−∞ to x] f(t) dt

- PDF is the derivative of CDF:
  f(x) = dF(x) / dx

- Interpretation:
  • CDF gives accumulated probability
  • PDF gives density (rate of change of probability)

- Example:
  P(X ≤ 40) = area under the PDF curve up to x = 40

TYPES OF PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS


1. BERNOULLI DISTRIBUTION (PMF)

- Bernoulli Distribution is the simplest discrete probability distribution.
- It models experiments with exactly two possible outcomes:
  success and failure.

- Parameters:
  p = P(success), where 0 ≤ p ≤ 1
  q = 1 − p
  k ∈ {0, 1}

- Probability Mass Function (PMF):
  P(X = k) = p^k (1 − p)^(1 − k)

  If k = 1 (success): P(X = 1) = p  
  If k = 0 (failure): P(X = 0) = 1 − p


- Examples:
  • Tossing a fair coin:
    P(H) = 0.5, P(T) = 0.5
  • Pass/Fail exam:
    P(pass) = 0.4, P(fail) = 0.6


MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY

- Mean of Bernoulli Distribution:
  • E(X) = Σ k · P(X = k),  k ∈ {0, 1}
  • E(X) = 0·(1 − p) + 1·p = p

- Median of Bernoulli Distribution:
  • If p < 1/2, Median = 0
  • If p = 1/2, Median ∈ [0, 1]
  • If p > 1/2, Median = 1

- Mode of Bernoulli Distribution:
  • If p > q, Mode = 1
  • If p < q, Mode = 0
  • If p = q, both 0 and 1 are modes


MEASURES OF DISPERSION

- Variance of Bernoulli Distribution:
  • Var(X) = σ² = p · q = p(1 − p)

- Standard Deviation:
  • σ = √(p · q)

2. BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION (PMF)

- Models the number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials.
- Parameters: n (number of trials), p (probability of success).


3. NORMAL / GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION (PDF)

- Continuous distribution with a bell-shaped curve.
- Defined by mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).


4. POISSON DISTRIBUTION (PMF)

- Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time
  or space.
- Parameter: λ (average rate of occurrence).


5. LOG-NORMAL DISTRIBUTION (PDF)

- A continuous distribution where the logarithm of the variable
  follows a normal distribution.


6. UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION

- All outcomes are equally likely.
- Can be discrete (PMF) or continuous (PDF).
