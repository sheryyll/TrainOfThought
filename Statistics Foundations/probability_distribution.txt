PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS

- Probability Distribution Functions describe how probabilities are
  distributed over the possible values of a random variable.

- A random variable is a variable whose values are determined
  by the outcome of a random experiment and is usually denoted by X.

TYPES OF PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS


1. PROBABILITY MASS FUNCTION (PMF)

- Probability Mass Function is used for discrete random variables.

- PMF is denoted by:
  P(X = x) or f(x)

- It gives the probability that a discrete random variable X
  takes a specific value x.

- Example:
  Rolling a fair die.

  P(X = 1) = P(X = 2) = P(X = 3) = P(X = 4) = P(X = 5) = P(X = 6) = 1 / 6

- In the graph:
  x-axis represents the possible values {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
  y-axis represents the corresponding probabilities {1/6}


2. PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION (PDF)

- Probability Density Function is used for continuous random variables.

- PDF is denoted by:
  f(x)

- For continuous random variables:
  P(X = x) = 0

- Probability is represented by the area under the curve
  between two points, not by exact values.

- Probability over an interval:
  P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = ∫[a to b] f(x) dx



PDF PROPERTIES

- Non-negativity:
  f(x) ≥ 0 for all values of x

- Total area under the PDF curve is equal to 1:
  ∫[−∞ to +∞] f(x) dx = 1

- The form of f(x) changes with different probability distributions.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

CUMULATIVE DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION (CDF)

- Cumulative Distribution Function represents the cumulative
  probability up to a certain value of the random variable.

- It is obtained by accumulating probabilities as we move
  from left to right along the x-axis.

- In the graph (discrete case):
  x-axis represents the values {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
  y-axis represents cumulative probabilities
  {1/6, 2/6, 3/6, 4/6, 5/6, 1}

- Example (discrete):
  P(X ≤ 2) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)


---------------------------------------------------------------------

RELATION BETWEEN PDF AND CDF

- Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) is denoted by:
  F(x)

- CDF is defined as:
  F(x) = P(X ≤ x)

- Range of CDF:
  0 ≤ F(x) ≤ 1

- The graph of CDF generally takes an S-shape.

- Relation between PDF and CDF:
  f(x) = dF(x) / dx
  (PDF is the derivative or gradient of the CDF)

- To calculate PDF from CDF:
  f(x) = slope of the CDF curve

- Slope formula:
  slope = (F(x2) − F(x1)) / (x2 − x1)


- Example:
  P(X ≤ 40) = area under the PDF curve up to x = 40

TYPES OD PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION

1. Bernouli Distribution: outcomes will be binary (PMF)

- It is the simplest discrete probability distribution.
- It represents the probability of a random variable that
  has exactly two possible outcomes : success (p) and failure ( 1-p)
- It id used to model binary outcomes, such as a coin flip or yes/no question.




2. Binomial Distribution: (pmf)
3. Normal / Gaussian Distribution: (pdf) (bell curve)
4. Poisson Distribution : (pmf)
5. Log Normal Distribution: (pdf)
6. Uniform Distribution: (pmf)
